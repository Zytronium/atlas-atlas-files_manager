# Files Manager Express

Files Manager Express is a Node.js backend project that demonstrates key
backend development concepts, including token-based user authentication,
file management, database integration, background processing, and API design.

The platform provides a simple API for uploading, managing, and
viewing files, with features such as:

* Token-based user authentication
* File listing with pagination support
* File upload functionality
* Permission management for files (public/private)
* Viewing and accessing file content
* Automatic thumbnail generation for image files

This project was designed as a learning exercise to bring together core
backend technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, and background workers
into a cohesive application.
